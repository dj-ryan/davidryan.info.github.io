      <p>HI!</p>
      <p>
        I was born and raised in Lincoln Nebraska. I have two amazing parents
        Jeff and Tori and 3 younger siblings Michael, Hannah and Jonathan. 
        <p>Education:</p>
        My
        entire K-12 education came from Homeschooling. My Mom built and tailored
        a yearly curriculum for me and my siblings until I was ?? at which point
        our family joined a Co-op called Classical Conversations. Classical
        Conversations (CC) uses a classical method of teaching where . I can
        confidently say that without the education I received in homeschooling I
        would not be the same person I am today. The environment of
        Homeschooling and CC allowed me to develop an extremely versatile
        cognitive mindset where I can absorbed new information and quickly
        relate it to content that I already know and understand.
      </p>
      <p>
        Following High School I entered the University of Nebraska Lincoln in
        the undergrad Computer Engineering program. I am currently a Junior in
        the program.
      </p>

      <p>
        In my free time I enjoy rock climbing, working on projects and hanging out with friends. 
      </p>

      <p>
        I came to faith in Jesus Christ when I was 9. 
        
        Currently I am apart of CityLight Church on O street. If you would like to visit or have a conversation
        about Jesus shoot me a message! I would love to talk!
      </p>
