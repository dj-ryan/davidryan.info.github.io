    <h1>3 Source Power Supply</h1>
    <div class="page-summery">
      This project was made possible by three high quality DC to DC converters
      that I obtained from my internship over the summer of 2020 at Virtual
      Incision. These DIN rail mounted converters are from Bel Power (Model:
      LDD240-WU) and provide DC to DC conversion with an output of 5-55VDC base
      on a input of 10A and 12-48VDC. Each power supply has several safety over
      current and under voltage protections that make each modal a self
      contained high preforming DC to DC converter. I received three of these
      modals

      <h3>Finished build</h3>
      The final purchases was the remaining two AC to DC converters. I purchased
      the exact same model as the first one (24V 10A) I then finished the
      assembly which consisted of mounting the AC to DC converters using the
      velcro straps, wiring the outputs to the inputs of the DC to DC converters
      and wiring the power outlets to the inputs of the AC to DC converters.
      Mounting the power strip at this point was a challenge. It would have been
      better to plan ahead for this. I ended unscrewing a screw on two of the AC
      to DC converters and replacing it with a longer one and a bolt so that it
      protruded from the side (but was still attached due to the bolt). I then
      used the mounting sockets on the power strip to slip it onto these
      protruding screws. The mount was stable enough and extended the side of
      the power supply a manageable amount. Also implemented a USB splitter to
      allow control of all three units through one port.

      <h3>Velcro straps and single power cable</h3>

      I finlay purchased some 18in velcro straps. These work perfect to hold
      down the AC to DC converters down. The only problem being if a nail is
      slightly slanted (which there are a few) the velcro strap has a tendency
      to slip to the edge. This isn't a major problem because the head of the
      nail will usually catch it. Another design flaw is that each AC to DC
      converter needs its own 120 volt power supply meaning I would need three
      outlets to run the device at full capacity. To solve this problem I
      purchased a 3 source power strip with an on and off switch as well as
      normal 120 volt plug breakouts so that I can wire them directly. <br />

      <h3>Added AC to DC converter support</h3>

      I purchased a single 24V 10A AC to DC converter figure out how I was going
      to mount it. I will eventually need three. I added a third support that
      extends off the base. There are three nails that are inserted
      perpendicularly into each side of the support for a total of 6. These
      nails will support velcro straps that will strap the AC to DC converters
      down.

      <h3>Constructed Frame</h3>

      I purchased an aluminum 12in DIN rail to mount all three of the voltage
      converters on. I designed a simple mounting frame out of 2x4. There are
      two posts that stand vertically on a base to make a U shaped frame. The
      DIN rail is mounted on the back side of the frame so that the voltage
      converters can rest on the inside of the U shape.
