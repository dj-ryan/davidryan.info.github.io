## About the Site

This website was written in HTML and CSS. Each project page on this site contains a summery, a timeline and a
parts
list of the project. The summery is at the top of the page and includes: the title, a description of the project
and
pictures of the project. The timeline is a list of the major mile stones of the project with the date and a short
description. The dates descends from greatest to least. The parts list is a table of the major parts used in the
project with links to purchasable ones.
This site is divided into two main sections:

1. Active Projects
2. Project Archive

The Active projects section is populated with projects that have not reach a meaningful conclusion or I am
still actively working on. I have not finalized the any pages in the Active Projects section so information that it
contains could be considered a draft.
The Project Archive section contains projects that I have finished or have ceased working on. At this point I have attempted to finalize the page with as much helpful and accurate information as possible.

The Resume and Contact section provides contact information and a short Bio for me as well as my most up-to-date resume.
