    <h1>Desktop Computer (THE DEFENDER)</h1>
    <div class="page-summery">
      I had the desire to build a computer during the ending years of highschool
      and at the beginning of college but never had the money or resources to
      justify the cost and time. Finally at the beginning of the summer of 2020
      I felt like I was in a position to pursue this desire. I then began to
      design the type of system that I wanted.
    </div>

    <div class="page-summery">
      Building a end-all be-all system with high end, maxed out components
      wouldn't make a lot of sense. First I wouldn't need this type of
      processing power and second because in a few short years all of those
      components would be outdated.

        >Vertical GPU Mount</a
      ><br />
      Mounted the GPU vertically to better exhibit the shroud of the MSI card.
      There is a possible thermal benefit with aligning the cooling fins within
      the card vertically however there is no proof of this yet. A small 180 degree adapter was needed for the graphics card power cable to prevent any contact with the RAM modals<br />

        >Hanging plant</a
      ><br />
      To finish the aesthetic of the build I hung a small plant from the venting
      grate on the top of the case. The plant hangs in the open space at the
      fornt of the case where the intake fans are located. It pulls the build
      together perfectly.

      <h3>FINISHED THE BUILD!</h3>

      The build took about 4 hour from parts to Windows. The two biggest
      problems was that I forgot to power the GPU during first post and also
      overheating the CPU during windows install. I wanted to make sure the
      system would post so after installing the GPU, RAM, CUP and storage I
      attempted a boot. The graphics card wasn't powering on and I soon realized
      this was because I wasn't giving it power from the power supply. After
      getting graphical output I attempted to install windows. At this point I
      did not have the CPU cooler installed however I did not think this was
      going to be a problem. I was completely wrong. Installing an OS is a very
      CPU intensive process and the CPU would overheat not very far into the
      install. I only realized this was my problem by acadentily touching the
      CPU (and burning myself). After that I installed the CPU cooler and the
      rest of the process was relatively smooth. Cable management was fairly
      clean. The case provided several convinitly placed ports with rubber flabs
      to feed cables through. The only complaint that I have is there was not a
      direct rout for the cables to take on the back side of the motherboard
      around the hard drive bays and into the PSU area. However, after it was
      all said and down my inner OCD was very pleased. I tuned all of the RGB to
      a white output which really pulled the build together and gave it that
      clean look that I was after. An unintentional byproduct was the reflection
      of RAM's white LEDs from the metal backing on the GPU. It actually splits
      the spectrum into RGB which looks pretty cool. I am extremely happy with
      the final product!

      I had originally purchased a basic $30 keyboard but soon realized that
      this would be the weak link in the chain. So I invested in this one. I am
      very pleased. It matches the build perfectly and I especially love the
      reflection of the backlight onto the silver finish.

      ><br />
      The motherboard choice came more out of necessity rather then preference.
      The great COVID-19 shortage really did a number on the PC component
      market. Nevertheless I am pleased with the it. Its a B550 model which were
      just released and had plenty of IO ports for my needs including USB 3.0
      Gen 2. The chipset was designed with Ryzon 3 in mind and would not need a
      BIOS updated which might be needed in the earlier B450 models. I also like
      the subtle RGB accenting next to the IO ports and audio drivers.<br />

      I was definitely not planning on getting this expensive of a monitor but I
      am glad that I did. I knew I wanted to purchases a IPS monitor because I
      wanted to be able to turn in into a vertical monitor with the longe term
      goal of having a multi monitor set up. However this limitation did not
      alow me to get a high refresh rate and high response time monitor in my
      price range. So I eventually decided to spend more and purchases this one
      which fit my need perfectly.

      I was teetering between the Ryzen 5700 and RTX 2060. I Finally decided on
      RTX 2060 because I wanted Ray Tracing and GeForce has reliable and feature
      filled drivers. The 5700 definitely has better performance but I was
      willing to do the trade off for the aforementioned benefits. It also
      included some RGB which was an added bonus and would help compleat my
      white led build. This card is also on the lower end of the midrange cards
      which gives me room to upgrade in the future.

      I knew that I wanted something minimal from Corsair that provided good air

      650 watts was plenty for this system and allowed some overhead for
      overclocking if I wanted to do that in the future. I was not worried about
      the efficiency rating because it wasn't worth the extra cost. EVGA is
      known to be a reliable PSU manufacture so I favored them in this decision.
