      <h1>Path Finding</h1>

      <div class="page-summery">
        This is a very general project to approach the problem of node path
        finding. I use several different languages including C++, Lua and
        Gdscript and have several different programs with different
        functionality and varying degrees of success.

        <h3>Chernobyl</h3>
        <p>
          Using c++ and map functionality there is a much more compleat way to
          calculate the number of moves it will take to get to a particular
          tile. Instead of calculating the number of steps based on the two
          points which would not take into account any obstacles in between the
          points it is better to start at the origin and step outwards in every
          possible direction and record the number of steps. This method allows
          for obstacles of irregular shape to be considered.
        </p>
        <p>
          This is the method that I implemented in Chernobyl. There is a master
          map of all coordinate values which are represented in a pair
          container. Mapped to each coordinate there is a step value. The
          program starts at the origin and then proceeds to check the nodes
          above, below, to the right and to the left of it. If these nodes are
          apart of the master map and they do not already have an assigned value
          the current step count is saved and the point is saved into another
          map where all previous points are saved. At the end of the loop the
          previous points map is saved in a current points map and the step
          counter is increased. The loop then starts at the top of the current
          points map and completes the same procedure for each node.
        </p>
        <p>
          This will then step through each possible node on the map. When
          encountering an obstacle the algorithm simply steps around the edge
          and records the proper step value.
        </p>
        <p>
          This creates a singular heat map that all other entities can use to
          path find towards or away from the origin using simple logic. The
          algorithm is far from being efficient. It can complete 25600 node
          calculations in just under 1000ms on a 3GHz processor.

        <h3>Lua script</h3>

        <p>
          The main inspiration behind writing this in lua script was to be able
          to port it over to a game called Crayta. This script is able when
          given a matrix, a player position and a goal position to find the
          shortest rout to the goal. It handles any number of convex obstacles
          such as a square or circle. The basic functionality of the algorithm
          calculates a heat map based on the distance from all tiles to the
          goal. This is calculated using the coordinates of the goal and the
          coordinates of the tile. Then some very basic movement logic chooses
          the largest value of all neighboring tiles. Any obstacles are given a
          value of 0 and are therefore never chosen.
        </p>

        <p>
          The problem arises when trying to handel concave shapes when the
          player starts inside the obstacle or the goal is inside the obstacle.
          This is because the heat map does not take into account back tracking.
          It only calculates the raw distance from the goal.
        </p>
        <p>
          The solution that I have begun developing is treating the open end or
          the "entrance" of the concave obstacle as a intermediate goal. Once
          this has been reached a new value matrix is calculated on the inside
          of the obstacle and the process is repeated.<br />
