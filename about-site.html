      <h1>About the Site</h1>
      <p>
        This website was written in HTML, CSS and javascript. It is served on a
        raspberry pi running the latest Raspbian Buster with PHP preprocessing.
        The domain is hosted by Google's DNS. (davidryan.info => 209.50.21.206)
        Each project page on this site if possible contains a summery, a
        timeline and a parts list of the project and any code/documents used.
        The summery is at the top of the page and includes: the title, a
        description of the project and pictures of the project. The timeline is
        a list of the major mile stones of the project with the date and a short
        description. The dates descends from greatest to least. The parts list
        is a table of the major parts used in the project with links to
        purchasable ones. The code and documents section contains any data
        sheets used and also an explanation of the code that was written.
        <br />This site is divided into two main sections:
      </p>
      <ol>
        <li>Active Projects</li>
        <li>Project Archive</li>
      </ol>

      <p>
        The Active projects section is populated with projects that have not
        reached a meaningful conclusion or I am still actively working on. I
        have not finalized the any pages in the Active Projects section so
        information that it contains could be considered a draft. The Project
        Archive section contains projects that I have finished or have ceased
        working on. At this point I have attempted to finalize the page with as
        much helpful and accurate information as possible.
      </p>
      <p>
        The Resume and Contact section provides contact information and a short
        Bio for me as well as my most up-to-date resume.
